# Marketing-Mix-Model

This is a project to help MAPE (a E-Commerce Company) to build marketing mix model by analyzing its sales and marketing data during 2015-2017. The purpose is to answer three questions: 

What are the impacts from different media channels on sales?
What are the ROI for each channel?
What will be the optimal spend and mix of marketing investments to maximise the ROI?

My work in the project include:

- Cleaned and managed the ETL process in SQL and then used Tableau to visualize the sales and independent variables individually and performed deep dive on each variable. 
- Used R to build Marketing Mix Model to evaluate the impact of various marketing tactics, including variables from the economic condition, media situation, and competitor information. 
- Built Tableau Dashboards to visualize model results generated informative visualizations including AVM, model contribution, and media ROIs to deliver critical business insights. 
- Optimized the budget using Excel Solver for the following year to increase sales by $ 0.36M and raise overall ROI by $0.59.
